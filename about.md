I am a goldsmith, photographer and aspiring web developer from Vienna, Austria now living in Bern, Switzerland. I studied goldsmithing at the [Wiener Goldschmiede Akademie](http://www.goldschmiedelehrgang.at/) and photography at [fotoK](http://www.fotok.at/). I worked about 4 years for the advertising agency [Jung von Matt/Donau](http://jvm.at/) where the content management of our website was one of my responsibilities. That got me interested in web development. I started with the a Front-End Web Development Certificate at the [O'Reilly School of Technology](http://archive.oreilly.com/oreillyschool/index.html?p=242) and went on to [bloc.io ]()to take their Full Stack Web Development Track. Now I am working on freelance projects.
